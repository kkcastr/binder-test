You've read a [blog post](https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/599947_7c545f28e24e4d21ab5dcbbb59210c63.html) by Glenn Moncrieff on Reproducibility in R. To collaborate share your work with others and encourage that it will run the same on their machine as your own, there are a number of options, which range from environment management to hosting an executable computing environment on a repository.

This notebook is intended to help you to put reproducibility into practice. We will review installing and using `renv`, as well as preparing a repository for binder using `holepunch`.

## Package Management with `renv`

To ensure that everyone on a project (and you, if you have multiple machines) is using the same packages and versions, we can use `renv` to manage our computing environment. This is particularly useful if you are collaborating with others on a team and committing to a common repository.

First, we install the library. The `type = "binary` argument elects to install a pre-compiled version rather than compiling the source on your machine, which is a much faster process. 

```{r}
install.packages("renv", type = "binary")
```

Then, we can initiate an R virtual environment. This may take a while, depending on the project, since it retrieves and installs all the packages you are using.

```{r}
renv::init()
```

To build a "lockfile" of your R environment that lists packages and versions, you can then run `renv::snapshot()` before committing your code changes.

A collaborator can then run `renv::restore()`, which will install packages and their dependencies, in their specific versions, based on the contents of the lockfiles. Alternatively, they may wish to use `renv::hydrate()` first, which checks to see if the packages specified in the lockfile are installed in the user environment and attempts to copy them to the project library; if not, it will continue with the installation.

A couple of caveats to note with `renv`:

*	It will not capture system dependencies (anything that must be installed on your machine outside of R for the code to run).
* Re-installing packages can take a while, even using `hydrate`.
* This requires a local install of R to run your code, which not everyone can do.

This last point is a significant barrier to reproducibility. In the coming sections, we'll set you up to instead create and host a free virtual machine from your code so that others can run your analysis interactively.

## Organizing your files in a data-driven project

Recall our class conversations on the rhetoricity of code, which included some recommendations for how code might be organized and styled within a script or code notebook. We reviewed conventions for making names of variables and functions more descriptive, effectively commenting code, and reorganizing code when "refactoring" to consolidate tasks that we notice ourselves using over and over in iterative, exploratory data analysis. Further, we talked about how `rmarkdown` enables embedding executable code alongside contextualizing text in a "literate programming" paradigm.

Making these conventional choices when authoring code balances the ability of machines and humans to read your code. These efforts begin to enable the reproducibility of your research, since your code is more easily navigable and intelligible. 

Taking this deliberate structuring for others a level up, folks using R and other scripting languages for reproducible research have moved to develop conventions for organizing files and directories. Because the needs of data analysis projects differ from the needs of other development, these research "compendia" differ slightly in form from other organizations of source files. 

You have already read Marwick et al.'s [article](https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375986) on compendia, which situates the development within its scholarly context, but can get a bit in the weeds. For an overview of compendia that you can return to as a reference you might review [this post](https://github.com/ropensci/rrrpkg).

Compendia vary depending on the expansiveness of the project. Generally speaking, the end goal toward transparency and reproducibility is to separate the input data from the processing and the output. The compendia will also contain a README file describing the contents and any documentation, licensing, and files specifying dependencies. (As an aside, here's a [Tool for generating ASCII trees](https://tree.nathanfriend.io) for your READMEs.)

# Taking reproducibility to next level: Binder

## Generating a Compendium

One of the reasons to adopt this set of conventions is that we can use the library `holepunch` to generate the structure for us and prepare it to be interacted with on binder.

The following code, along with the other files in this repo, is adapted from the [GitHub Repo for holepunch](https://github.com/karthik/binder-test).

First, we install the package from GitHub.

```{r}
install.packages("remotes", type = "binary")
remotes::install_github("karthik/holepunch", type = "binary")
```

Like Moncrieff recommends, we might run some code to specify some details about us.

```{r}
require("usethis")

options(
  usethis.full_name = "Gregory Palermo",
  usethis.description = list(
    `Authors@R` = 'person("Gregory", "Palermo", email = "gregory.palermo@emory.edu", role = c("aut", "cre")',
    License = "MIT",
    usethis.title = "My Test Compendium Compendium"
    )
  )

```

Then, we can create the compendium.
```{r}
library(holepunch)
write_compendium_description(package = "Test Compendium",
                             description = "Getting acquainted with reproducibility in R")
# to write a description, with dependencies listed 
# It's good practice to now go fill in the placeholder text.
```

```{r}
write_dockerfile(maintainer = "Gregory Palermo") 
# To write a dockerfile. It will automatically pick the date of the last modified file, match it to 
# that version of R and add it here. You can override this by passing r_date to some arbitrary date
# (but one for which a R version exists).
```

```{r}
generate_badge()
# This generates a badge for your readme.

# At this time ðŸ™Œ push the code to GitHub ðŸ™Œ
# If you're new to Git/GitHub, you can click the Git tab on Rstudio, then click commit to see
# all changed files/folders, including the hidden .binder folder. Give this a commmit message and push

# And click on the badge or use the function below to get the binder built ahead of time.
build_binder()

```
